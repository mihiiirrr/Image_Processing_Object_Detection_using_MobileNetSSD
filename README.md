Project Title: Object Detection using OpenCV and MobileNetSSD

Overview:
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline of computer vision applications using OpenCV and the pre-trained MobileNetSSD deep learning model. It covers fundamental image operations, user interaction through mouse events, thresholding techniques, working with live video streams, motion detection, and advanced object detection on both images and videos. The goal is to gradually build up knowledge from basics of OpenCV to real-time intelligent applications.

Why this project:
This project provides a hands-on understanding of computer vision concepts, starting from fundamentals and building up to advanced deep learning-based object detection. It simulates real-world use cases such as motion-based surveillance, automated object recognition, and interactive image applications. The step-by-step progression of files ensures a solid foundation in both classical computer vision and modern deep learning approaches.


Requirements:

* Python 3.x

* NumPy
* Matplotlib (for visualization in experiments)
* Pretrained MobileNetSSD model files:
  1. MobileNetSSD\_deploy.prototxt (model architecture)
  2. MobileNetSSD\_deploy.caffemodel (pre-trained weights)

Both model files must be downloaded and stored in the specified directory path used in the scripts.
